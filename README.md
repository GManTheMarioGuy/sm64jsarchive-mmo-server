## Prerequisites

- Postgres database, e.g. via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/).
- `libpq-dev` for Debian based distros.
- copy and rename the file `.env.template` to `.env` and insert your environment variables.

## Development

The server will also serve client assets, so they first need to be compiled.
You will have to navigate to the `client` folder and run `npm run build` once after installing dependencies
via `npm install`.
For development you can instead run `npm run build:dev`
or use webpack-dev-server (WIP).

In your `.env` file, you don't have to insert all variables for local development.
It is only mandatory to have a running Postgres database, thus you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable.
Currently only Google sign-in is mocked, so you will have to use this,
if you cannot set up the Discord environment variables.

If you also cannot manage to run your own Postres database, you can instead contact me
(Tarnadas#0582 @ Discord) and I might give you access to the Postgres instance of the staging environment.

You can then start the server via `cargo run`.
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3060`.
Every time you make changes to the client, you will have to rebuild client assets via `npm run build:dev`.
Restarting the server is not required.

### Adding new levels

To add a new level for the MMO server, you need to do these tasks:

- Define a good levelId. If it is a custom level, you should be using a levelId >= 1000.
  Otherwise use the levelId that is also internally used by Super Mario 64
- Add the name and levelId to [./client/src/utils.js]() `levelIdToName` constant.
- Add the name and levelId to [./client/src/index.html]() `#mapSelect` selection.
